## Migration Criteria (Quality-First)

Will migrate to LLM extraction IF AND ONLY IF:
- ✅ Location Accuracy ≥90%
- ✅ Leadership Precision ≥95%

**Philosophy:** "2 high quality jobs > 10 medium quality jobs"

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation with Task 1.0 (Database Schema & Migrations)
2. Follow tasks sequentially as defined in `tasks.md`
3. Ensure ≥80% test coverage on all new code
4. Update this status file as tasks are completed
5. Move directory to `llm-job-extraction-IN_PROGRESS` when work begins

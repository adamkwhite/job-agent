**Friday:** Client responds: "We called RoboTech - this role was filled 3 weeks ago. Are you sure you're on top of the market?"

**Sarah's reputation:** Damaged. Client questions her competence.

**Sarah's time wasted:** 4 hours on research, outreach, and coordination for a job that didn't exist.

---

**After Job-Agent:**

**Wednesday:** Job-Agent auto-validates all jobs in Sarah's streams

**Job-Agent alert:** "Warning: 3 jobs marked as potentially stale (posted >30 days ago, URL may be inactive)"

**Sarah's workflow:**

**Wednesday:** No response (cold email ignored)

**Outcome:** Missed opportunity, no placement.

---

**After Job-Agent:**

**Monday:** Job-Agent shows "Director of Hardware at Chef Robotics (84 points, B-grade)"

**Job-Agent connection insight:** "You have 2 connections at this company: Mike Johnson (VP Engineering), Lisa Chen (Recruiter)"

**Sarah's workflow:**
1. Clicks on Mike Johnson's profile
2. Sends LinkedIn message: "Hi Mike, saw Chef Robotics is hiring a Director of Hardware. I have a great candidate who led mechatronics at Boston Dynamics. Mind if I intro you?"
3. Mike responds within 2 hours: "Yes! Please send over their profile."
4. Sarah makes intro, candidate interviews, gets offer
5. **Placement fee:** $37,500 (25% of $150K salary)

**Outcome:** $37,500 placement thanks to LinkedIn connection insight.

---

### **Scenario 4: Scaling to New Verticals Without Drowning**

**Before Job-Agent:**

**Q1:** Sarah specializes in robotics exec placements (3 placements/month)

**Q2:** Boss asks Sarah to also cover fintech director roles (new client vertical)

**Sarah's response:** "I can try, but I'm already spending 30 hours/week finding robotics jobs. If I add fintech, I'll have no time for candidate outreach."

**Outcome:** Sarah declines, firm misses revenue opportunity.

---

**After Job-Agent:**

**Q1:** Sarah uses Job-Agent for robotics execs (6 placements/month thanks to time savings)

**Q2:** Boss asks Sarah to cover fintech director roles

4. Job-Agent starts aggregating fintech jobs from all sources
5. Sarah receives first digest next morning: "12 new fintech director jobs"
6. **Time to set up:** 10 minutes
7. **Weekly time on fintech job discovery:** 1 hour (instead of 15 hours manually)

**Outcome:** Sarah now covers 2 verticals (robotics + fintech), makes 9 placements/month (up from 3), boss is thrilled.

## Key Takeaways for Recruiting Firms

**If you're a recruiting firm considering Job-Agent:**

1. **Your recruiters are probably spending 50-70% of their time on manual job discovery.**
   - Ask them: "How many hours/week do you spend searching job boards?"
   - If answer is >15 hours/week, you have a problem

2. **This is costing you $1-2M+/year in recruiter time** (for a 20-person team)
   - Fully-loaded cost: $70-100/hour per recruiter
   - 25 hours/week × 20 recruiters × 52 weeks × $70/hour = $1.82M/year

3. **You're leaving $10M+/year on the table in lost placements**
   - Recruiters who spend time on relationships (not data entry) make 2X more placements
   - 50 placements/month → 100 placements/month = +$18M/year revenue

4. **Job-Agent costs <1% of the benefit** ($24K/year subscription vs. $1.8M savings + $18M revenue increase)

5. **Payback period: Less than 1 day**
   - Month 1: Save $142K in recruiter time, pay $2K for subscription
   - Net benefit: $140K in Month 1 alone

**Questions for your team:**
- "How much time do our recruiters spend finding jobs vs. building relationships?"
- "If we could give recruiters 25 extra hours/week, what would they do with it?"
- "How many more placements could we make if job discovery took 1 hour/week instead of 30 hours?"

**If the answers reveal inefficiency, Job-Agent is your solution.**

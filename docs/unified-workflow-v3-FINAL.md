### Parser Fixes Applied

#### 1. LinkedIn Extractor ✅ FIXED
**Before**: 3 companies (Montreal, Intact, "Intact is still available.")
**After**: 22 companies (Dropbox, NVIDIA, Bloomberg, Coinbase, GM, etc.)

**Changes**:
- Added location filtering (40+ cities/regions)
- Added footer text filtering
- Improved pattern matching to look for company after job title
- Skip boilerplate text

**Code**:
```python
# Known locations to filter
LOCATIONS = {
    'remote', 'hybrid', 'toronto', 'montreal', 'vancouver',
    'san francisco', 'new york', 'boston', ...
}

# Skip footer text
skip_phrases = ['you are receiving', 'unsubscribe', ...]
```

#### 2. Supra Extractor ✅ FIXED
**Before**: 1 company (Group Product Manager - wrong, extracted job title)
**After**: 27 companies (Perforce, PayPal, Walmart, Salesforce, Figma, Google, etc.)

**Changes**:
- New pattern: `*Company Name* is hiring`
- Extracts actual job posting URLs (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday)
- Handles real Supra email format

**Code**:
```python
# Pattern: *Company Name* is hiring
pattern = re.compile(r'\*([A-Za-z0-9\s&.,\'-]+)\*\s+is hiring')

# Find careers URL after company mention
url_match = re.search(r'https?://[^\s<>]+(?:greenhouse|lever|ashby|workable|jobs)[^\s<>]+', context)
```

#### 3. Job Bank Extractor ✅ FIXED
**Before**: Company name = "Www"
**After**: Company name = "Jobbank"

**Changes**:
- Skip "www" prefix when extracting domain
- Handle government domains properly

#### 4. Built In Extractor ⚠️ NOT FIXED
**Status**: 0 companies from 7 emails
**Impact**: Low - other sources provide sufficient coverage
**Action**: Can be fixed later if needed

## Production Deployment

### Command
```bash
# Run all sources (recommended)
PYTHONPATH=$PWD job-agent-venv/bin/python src/jobs/unified_scraper_v3.py

# Email + CSV (skip browser extension)
PYTHONPATH=$PWD job-agent-venv/bin/python src/jobs/unified_scraper_v3.py --email-limit 100

# Test with small batch
PYTHONPATH=$PWD job-agent-venv/bin/python src/jobs/unified_scraper_v3.py --email-limit 20 --csv-only
```

### Cron Schedule (Recommended)
```cron
# Monday 9am - Weekly scraper
0 9 * * 1 cd /home/user/job-agent && PYTHONPATH=$PWD job-agent-venv/bin/python src/jobs/unified_scraper_v3.py --email-limit 100 >> logs/unified-scraper-v3.log 2>&1
```

**Timeline**: Ready now

**Risk**: Minimal - single non-critical issue with Built In parser

**Next Step**: Update cron job and monitor first production run

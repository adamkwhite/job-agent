## Email Routing

**Where should these emails go?**

**Option A**: Forward to Adam
- Easiest to set up
- You manually forward job alert emails to adamkwhite@gmail.com
- Adam's system processes them

**Option B**: Dedicated Gmail account
- Create mario.jobalerts@gmail.com
- All alerts go there automatically
- Adam connects the system to that account
- **Recommended** (cleaner, automated)

**Let Adam know which option you prefer!**

## What Happens Next?

1. **Week 1**: You'll start receiving 20-40 job emails/week
2. **Week 1-2**: Adam creates email parsers for the new formats
3. **Week 2**: System starts scoring jobs for you
4. **Week 3+**: You get weekly digest emails with 5-10 QA/testing matches!

## Expected Results

**Before** (current state):
- 0 jobs in digests (last 7 days)
- 0.99% of all jobs qualify for you
- Digest emails are empty

**After** (with QA-specific sources):
- 5-10 jobs per weekly digest

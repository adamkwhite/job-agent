### Command
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD job-agent-venv/bin/python src/jobs/unified_scraper_v3.py --email-limit 100
```

### Cron Setup
```cron
# Monday 9am - Weekly scraper
0 9 * * 1 cd /home/user/job-agent && PYTHONPATH=$PWD job-agent-venv/bin/python src/jobs/unified_scraper_v3.py --email-limit 100 >> logs/unified-scraper-v3.log 2>&1
```

## Parser Implementation Details

### LinkedIn Parser
```python
# Format: Job Title\nCompany Name\nLocation
# Filter out locations and footer text
LOCATIONS = {'remote', 'toronto', 'montreal', 'new york', ...}
skip_phrases = ['you are receiving', 'unsubscribe', ...]
```

### Supra Parser
```python
# Format: *Company Name* is hiring a Job Title -
#         https://jobs.lever.co/...
pattern = re.compile(r'\*([A-Za-z0-9\s&.,\'-]+)\*\s+is hiring')
url_match = re.search(r'https?://[^\s<>]+(?:greenhouse|lever|ashby|workable)', context)
```

### Job Bank Parser
```python
# Handle www prefix
if parts[0].lower() == "www" and len(parts) > 1:
    company_name = parts[1].title()  # "www.jobbank.gc.ca" â†’ "Jobbank"
```

### Built In Parser
```python
# Extract job URLs from AWS tracking links
url_pattern = r'href="([^"]*(?:builtin\.com(?:%2F|/)job(?:%2F|/)[^"]+))"'
# Decode: %2F â†’ /, %3F â†’ ?, %3D â†’ =
# Store URLs in notes field
```

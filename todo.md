# TODO

## High Priority

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Fix test import errors - tests are failing to import from `src` module
  - Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`
  - All 5 test files affected: test_builtin_parser.py, test_jobbank_parser.py, test_processor_v2.py, test_recruiter_parser.py, test_workintech_parser.py
  - PYTHONPATH is set but tests still fail - may need pytest.ini configuration or conftest.py
  - Blocking: Cannot verify test coverage or run quality checks

### Company Scraping Automation
- [ ] Consider full automation options for company scraping:
  - Option 1: Set up Firecrawl API key and call REST API directly from Python
  - Option 2: Implement Playwright-based scraper for JavaScript-heavy sites
  - Option 3: Keep current semi-automated workflow (minimal maintenance burden)
- [ ] Document weekly company scraping workflow for user/maintainer
- [ ] Test full end-to-end scraping of all 26 companies (currently tested with 2)

## Medium Priority

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up monitoring for cron job failures
- [ ] Add email alerts if weekly scraper fails
- [ ] Create dashboard for job scraping metrics (jobs found, scored, sent)

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add tests for new company scraping functionality
  - scrape_companies_with_firecrawl.py
  - company_scraper.py
  - firecrawl_career_scraper.py
- [ ] Improve test coverage (currently at ~25%)
- [ ] Add type hints to new scraping modules

## Low Priority

### Features
- [ ] Configurable scoring weights (Issue #4)
- [ ] Daily digest option (Issue #3)
- [ ] Resume customization automation
- [ ] Interview preparation automation

### Documentation
- [ ] Add examples of successful company scraping runs
- [ ] Document Firecrawl MCP tool usage patterns
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common scraping issues

# End-of-Day Wrap-Up

## 1. Session End Time

Use `mcp__time__get_current_time` with timezone `America/Toronto`:

**Session ending at:** [Display time from time server]

---

## 2. File Organization & Cleanup

### Root Directory Cleanup
- Check for temporary files in root (temp_*, debug_*, demo_*, scratch_*)
- Verify README.md structure matches actual directories
- Move bug screenshots to `bugs/` directory
- Move issue documentation to `issues/` directory
- Check if any docs should move to `docs/archive/`

### Git Housekeeping
```bash
git status  # Review all changes
```
- Stage all intentional deletions and moves
- Verify untracked files should exist or be gitignored
- Check `.gitignore` is catching test-results/ and build artifacts

## 3. SEO & Website Maintenance (CRITICAL)

### If New Pages Were Added
Run through `docs/SITE_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md` checklist:
